# COLHEX

COLHEX is a real-time, fast-paced 2D iOS party game developed using Swift and SpriteKit in Xcode. The game can be played alone againsnt simple AI, or with up to 6 players locally. <br>
The name COLHEX represents a combination of the words "colour" and "hexagon," and is also a play on words since it also sounds like the word "collects," which describes the goal of the players -> to collect and claim as many hexagons for themselves. <br>
All 2D art assets were created by me in Adobe Illustrator.

Available for FREE on the Apple App Store since December 2017: <br>

Here is its description with instructions as seen on the App Store:

__________________

Conquer the board with your colour in COLHEX!
Play solo or with up to five friends, all on the same screen!

Each player must first choose one of six colours. When the game begins, players will have 30 seconds to claim as many hexagons as they can with their colour. This is done by tapping on hexagons, which spreads colours in an circular pulse. When the time is up, the player with the most hexagons of their colour wins!

The game plays in real-time, so it is fast-paced! 
Be quick! Be accurate!
It only takes a few taps for other players to take over your claimed hexagons! And be careful not to tap other players' colours!
